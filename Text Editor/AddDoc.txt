The Project required the Buffer Structure to use either the Gap Buffer Class or the Linked List Buffer Class. 
To accomplish this changes had to be made to the Buffer Structure class. The GapBuffer array gb_array was
Changed to a GapBufferInterface array. This is because the LinkedListBuffer and GapBuffer classes both implement
From the array.
To facilitate this the BufferStructure constructor was changed to have a parameter of String variable “type “
This type would be passed in the main method of the Editor class
Thus, in the program any time an object of BufferStructure was being created, it was changed to accept a parameter
With an added if-else condition that the array formed would be of either LinkedListBuffer or GapBuffer depending on the String
Passed.

2 new methods were also created. In the BufferStructure class a method called StringToForPrint was created.
This is because the original toString method was outputting the string of the Buffer Structure in a different format
Then from what was required. This method is called in the Editor class when loading a document.
The second method was using the remove_line method in the Document class to create an overloaded version 
Which takes in an integer value to remove multiple lines. This was also used in the Editor class.

No other changes were made.
